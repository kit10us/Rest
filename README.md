# Kit10's Rest API 
About a decade ago I was creating a professional applications that required use of the Rest API. At the time, there wasn't a suitable library for my needs. One of these needs was simplicity, the ones that were available just had too much bloat for my simple needs. Because of this, I created this Rest API. 

It is simple, however,it is also dated. Consider the code yours to do with what you want, it's not really very revilutionary in any sense.

Consider it under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

I had also wanted a simple JSON API, you can find that at [https://github.com/kit10us/JSONCS].
